			<h1>What is Coronavirus ?</h1>
			<p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
				Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
				<br><br>
				In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
				SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
				infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory
				tract (windpipe and lungs).
				<br><br>
				It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections
				range from mild to deadly.
				<br><br>
				SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like
				Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other
				coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for
				otherwise healthy people.

			<h1>What is Covid-19?</h1>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8]

	Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,
	[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and
	 loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one 
	 to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.<br><br> At least a third
	  of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14]
	   Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be 
	   classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms
	   (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms<br><br>
	    (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging),
		 and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or<br><br>
		  multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk
		   of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to 
		   experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after
		    recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16]<br><br>
			 Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the
			  long-term effects of the disease.[16]</p>

			<h1>Prevention</h1>
			<p>Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene,
				washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing
				into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the
				infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public. Physical distancing measures are also
				recommended to prevent transmission. Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected
				are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.</p>
			<p> Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they
				have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
				Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest
				self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups. Those who may have been
				exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the
				widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible
				exposure</p>

			<h1>Social Distancing</h1>
			<p>In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing,[2][3][4] is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other.[2][5] It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups.[6][7]

				By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person
				 will come into physical contact with an infected person, the
				  disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer
				   deaths.<br><br>[2] The measures may be used in combination with
				    others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and
					 hand washing.[8][9]<br><br> To slow down the spread of infectious
					  diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems,
					   particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing
					    measures are used, including the closing of schools and
						 workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the
						  movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings.<br><br>
						  [5][10] Drawbacks of social distancing can include
						   loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other
						    benefits associated with human interaction.[11]</p>

	<h1>Hygiene towards Covid-19</h1>
	<p>• Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.<br><br>
		• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.<br><br>
		• Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.<br><br>
		• Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.<br><br></p>
